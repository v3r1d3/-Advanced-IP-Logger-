IP LOGGER PHP

Here is an advanced IP logger in PHP that ensures the ip address is valid by going through several checks.

How it works

The process is really simple. When the victim enters the site, they will receive a 404 error message (which makes it look even more realistic). Then it gets the IP address of the victim, validates it and logs it in a txt file which contains the IP address, country and the current date.
